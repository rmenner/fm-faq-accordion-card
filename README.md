## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I used this challange as a way to get better with the Svelte framework. Added subtle bits of animation to practice with the utilities Svelte has to offer. Also setup events so only one answer could be opened at one time.
